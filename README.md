# 2d-game-demo

A simple demo/test of a 2d platform game with various floor types:
- default
- stone (increased friction)
- ice (decreased friction)
- slime (greatly increased friciton and no possibility to jump)
- change the gravity block (when jumped from, changes the gravity revealing ceiling containing all the blocks mentioned above with a little different colour style)
